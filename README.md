Hey, I'm Ian. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer and consultant from the UK. I've worked in the industry for 12 years and I still wake up every morning with a passion for technology. These days, I need a coffee to help me get going though... ðŸ˜‰

If you're interest in:

 - JavaScript or TypeScript
 - PHP
 - Serverless or Cloud Infrastruture
 - Devops or CI/CD

We might have a few things in common... lets have a chat! Drop me a message [@ianoshorty](https://twitter.com/ianoshorty)<a href="https://twitter.com/ianoshorty"><img height="30" src="https://github.com/ianoshorty/ianoshorty/blob/main/assets/twitter.png?raw=true"></a>.
