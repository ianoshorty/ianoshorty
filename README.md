### Hey, I'm Ian. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer and consultant from the UK ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§. I'm also the Technical Director at [Komodo Digital](https://www.komododigital.co.uk).

I've worked in the software development industry for 12 years and I still wake up every morning with a passion for technology. These days, I need a coffee to help me get going though... ðŸ˜‰

### ðŸ’¸ ONE:HOUR:FREE

_2020 was a bit pants_ - but it made me realise I can be doing more to help others. To that end...

**I donate 1 hour free, at 12pm UK time, every Saturday to good causes - and you can watch live on twitch at [twitch.tv/onehourfree](https://twitch.tv/onehourfree).**

I'm looking to help out folks in any way I can during these difficult times. If you've got something I can be helpful with, during 1 session or spanning weeks / months, drop me a message at [@onehourfree](https://twitter.com/onehourfree) on <a href="https://twitter.com/onehourfree"><img height="20" src="https://github.com/ianoshorty/ianoshorty/blob/main/assets/twitter.png?raw=true"></a>. 

This can be anything thats a good cause (and doesn't have to be anything related to technology or software development), but could include:

 - You want help with your project (ideally something like a non-profit / charity org)
 - You want someone to bounce some ideas off with technical knowledge
 - You want some career guidence or mentoring

You can find out more in [my twitch bio](https://twitch.tv/onehourfree)!

>**Note:** Due to personal and work commitments, I've had to pause this. It may come back, whow knows...

### ðŸ’¬ Talking Tech

I love to talk about software development. If you're interest in:

 - Creating great software / web applications
 - Being helpful
 - JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP or Objective-C
 - React, GraphQL, Next, Express, Gatsby, React Native, Laravel, WordPress
 - Serverless or Cloud Infrastruture (mainly on AWS)
 - Devops or CI/CD (mainly using Docker, Jenkins, CircleCI)
 - Testing (Jest, Mocha, PHPUnit)
 - Tooling

We might have a few things in common... lets have a chat! 

Drop me a message [@ianoshorty](https://twitter.com/ianoshorty) on <a href="https://twitter.com/ianoshorty"><img height="20" src="https://github.com/ianoshorty/ianoshorty/blob/main/assets/twitter.png?raw=true"></a>
