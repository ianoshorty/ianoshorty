Hey, I'm Ian. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer and consultant from the UK. I've worked in the industry for 12 years and I still wake up every morning with a passion for technology. These days, I need a coffee to help me get going though... ðŸ˜‰

If you're interest in:

 - JavaScript or TypeScript
 - PHP
 - Serverless or Cloud Infrastruture
 - Devops or CI/CD

We might have a few things in common... lets have a chat! 

Drop me a message [@ianoshorty](https://twitter.com/ianoshorty) on <a href="https://twitter.com/ianoshorty"><img height="20" src="https://github.com/ianoshorty/ianoshorty/blob/main/assets/twitter.png?raw=true"></a>

### ONE:HOUR:FREE

2020 was a bit pants - but it made me realise I can be doing more to help others. To that end...

**I donate 1 hour free, at 12pm UK time, every Saturday to good causes - and you can watch live on twitch at [twitch.tv/onehourfree](https://twitch.tv/onehourfree).**

I'm looking to help out folks in any way I can during these difficult times. If you've got something I can be helpful with, during 1 session or spanning weeks / months, drop me a message at [@onehourfree](https://twitter.com/onehourfree) on <a href="https://twitter.com/onehourfree"><img height="20" src="https://github.com/ianoshorty/ianoshorty/blob/main/assets/twitter.png?raw=true"></a>. 

This can be anything thats a good cause (and doesn't have to be anything related to technology or software development), but could include:

 - You want help with your project (ideally something like a non-profit / charity org)
 - You want someone to bounce some ideas off with technical knowledge
 - You want some career guidence or mentoring

You can find out more in [my twitch bio](https://twitch.tv/onehourfree)!
